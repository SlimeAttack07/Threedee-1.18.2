# Threedee (WIP)
This mod adds many 3D models to the game, along with a unique way to obtain them, simple machines and some decorative blocks.
This mod is currently still being developed..

Currently, a large amount of reworking will be done before this mod is published. This is an old modthat I started on way before I started on Naval Warfare, and as such this mod is quite outdated. I plan on removing certain features and improving on others. Currently, the list of future changes is as follows:
*  All head models will be removed and replaced by 3D models. Not all heads may receive a 3D model, in which case they are removed and the total amount of models lowers.
* More recipes for the basic interactables will be added.
* Configs will be added.
* Class code will be cleaned up a bit where possible.
* Custom sounds (maybe)
